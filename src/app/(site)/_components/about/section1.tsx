                  Among my earliest art influences and training grounds were my mother’s clothes designs;shegave  me  her  delight  for texture, and  the  nuances  of  color,and my father’s story-telling  feats-Both  my  parents  gave  me  a  passion  for  exploring  narrative  as a multilayered  construction  of meaning. Other early   influences   were my  native  city’s  omnipresent  visual  worlds  of handweaving  arts,  first  centuries  BCE and CE monumental  representational  mosaic  paintings-Tunisia has the world’s largest ancient mosaic  collection-and architectural vestiges  of  bygone Roman  Empire.Visual  story-telling  and  ancient  scripts  have  held  my  focus  since  childhood. There,  the  first  waves  of  infinite  geometric  designs  and  limitless  color  palettes  permeated  my psyche. Fallen or still standing marble statues of all sizes, millenniaold texts hand-engraved on mountain  sides  or steles,  and  very  young  olive  trees  cracking  life  open  right  through  ancient columns in my  native Carthage, Tunisiaand across North Africa are still among my sources of inspiration-My  years at  the  Ibn  Rachiq  Art  Center  in Tunis as  a  national multidisciplinary puppet  theatreartistwith  the  OTEMA  (The  National Organization for  Puppet  Theatre) still resonate inmy  work. After several  decades  of  life  in  the  American  Northwest I have also become inhabited and taught by thegeographic and the human landscapesof this gorgeouspart of mother earth.

                  My mother gave mea small box of basic colors pencilswhen I was four years old. I have since paintedto communicate and travel through “time” and “space”, and to cross real or imagined boundaries even duringstudies for myundergraduate and graduate art degrees. In the past I have described  my  painting  work  as  semi-abstract  or  surrealistic. The  truth  is  thatmy work doesn’t and shouldn’t fit  in  any  already  established  category.  I  pay  homage  to  great  artists  from  the South  and  the  North,  the  East  and  the  West  who  have  preceded  me,  and I find  inspiration wherever and whenever my brush and concepts find grounding form and pigment.

                  The formal  qualitiesof  the works  in  my exhibitionsareinfluenced  by  all  manifestations  of nature,  by  poetry,  Film,  linguistics, and art  Historiesas  parts  of  a  multidisciplinary  art  practice that  I  have  relied  on for  several  decadesfor  the  development  of  a personal  aesthetics. My paintings  and  Installations are usuallyabout multiple  themes, largely  inspired  by  a  sense  of realism  and  the  need  for  collective,  life-nurturing visionsand  practices. I  mergeapainting technique  grounded  in  my  own “organic” use  of  the alphabetical  multilingualletter  as  a  plasticart medium with ancient and current myths and elements of Art Historiesto createpaintings that can be  of  very  limited  palette  or run  the  gamut  of  the  color wheel. I  use individual  letters  and single large diacritical signs (sound-making symbols) or minute brush strokes and traditional nib lines on paper or canvas to construct spaces and objective and nonobjective forms in non-linearspace arrangements. Sometimes minimalist as a proverb,small narratives mergefromthe overall narrative of the painting.Shifting form of line tries to take the written letter back to a primal and physiological  origin,as, for  example, in  my  paintingL’Aiisha; Life  in  our  Nameswhere four North  American mothers/deitiesfrom current and  ancient erashold  a joyful conversation with their 21stcentury   living daughter   and   grandson,   or as   in my   paintingof the mythical Firebird/Simorgh/the  Phoenix/the Sphynx”that  covers a  large span of the  sky  while  it  holds conversation with its human children as they hang down from under her wings,or watch various kinds  of  “passages”  and  cross  somethemselves,  or as  in my  painting  “Circus  and  Steady Dancers” where  all  kinds  of  real  or  imaginary  creatures remind  central  dancersof scenes  frompastand  presentworldsofdesires, passion,playand resilience. Without  exception,  all  my artwork begins with the possibility of LOVE and ends with it.
